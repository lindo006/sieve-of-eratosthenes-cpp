# Prime Number Sieve (Sieve of Eratosthenes) in C++

A command-line C++ implementation of the classic Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified limit. The program counts primes, tracks computational complexity, and saves formatted results to a text file.

## Features

- **Efficient Prime Detection**: Implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
- **Step Counter**: Tracks the number of computational steps for algorithm analysis
- **File Export**: Automatically saves results to a formatted text file
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interaction
- **Formatted Output**: Outputs primes in readable columns with summary statistics

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (g++, clang++, or MSVC)
- Standard C++ library support
